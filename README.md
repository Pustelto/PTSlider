# JS Slider Plugin (WIP)

__current version: 0.1.0__

This is my own custom JS slider plugin - it's base on slider plugin I wrote for my web for scout course [Ficak](http://www.ficak.skauting.cz). But that version is a bit crude and I've got much better understanding of JS since that time. So I've desided do rewrite that plugin and to make it a standalone JS plugin in order to polish my JS skills and learn a new things in process.

Feel free to use it in your projects if you wish (and when it's done :-))

My aim was to create lightweight vanilla JS plugin which can be used in most cases and can be styled easily. You can use almout any markup as a base for the slider (use `<div>`, `<ul>` or something else). Only condition is to have container with only items inside of it. Rest will be handled by the plugin itself.

FIXME - example of markup
