# JS Slider Plugin

__current version: 0.0.1__

This is my own custom JS slider plugin - it's base on slider plugin I wrote for my web for scout course [Ficak](www.ficak.skauting.cz). But that version is a bit crude and I got much better understanding of JS since that time. So I've desided do rewrite that plugin and to make it a standalone JS plugin in order to polish my JS skills and lear a new things in process.

Feel free to use it in your projects if you wish (and when it's done :-))
